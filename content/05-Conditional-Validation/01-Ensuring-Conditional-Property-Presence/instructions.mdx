# Conditional Validation
Congratulations! You have made so far. We will learn about conditional validation in module 


## What is Conditional Validation?

Conditional validation involves applying validation rules based on the presence or absence of other properties in the JSON document.

**For Example:**
- **dependentRequired**: if a property `A` is present, then property `B` must be present. 

- **if-then-else**: if a sub-schema `A` is valid then sub-schema `B` must be valid, else sub-schema `C` must be valid.

- **implications**: if sub-schema `A` is valid then sub-schema `B` must be valid.

we will see each of these in detail in the upcoming lessons.

## dependentRequired


Consider a scenario where you have a JSON document with two properties `name` and `age`. You want to make sure that if the `name` property is present, then the `age` property must also be present.

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Schema 

To achieve this, you can use the `dependentRequired` keyword in JSON Schema. The `dependentRequired` keyword allows you to specify that a property is required if another property is present.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "number"
    }
  },
  "dependentRequired": {
    "age": ["name"]
  }
}
```

In the above schema, the `age` property is required if the `name` property is present. If the `name` property is not present, the `age` property is not required.


## Task 

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "creditCardNumber":"1234 5678 1234 5678",
  "address":"123 Main St",
}
```

You are given a *Schema* for the above JSON document in the side editor. Update the schema to make sure that if the `creditCardNumber` property is present, then the `address` property must also be present.
