# Age or Date of Birth

In the previous step, we had `age` and `dateOfBirth` properties in the schema. However, we want to make sure that only one of these properties is present in the JSON document.

**We will keep these conditions in mind:**
- if `age` is present, `dateOfBirth` should not be present, and vice versa.
- both `age` and `dateOfBirth` should not be present at the same time.
- if none of them is present, the document should be invalid.

```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": "1999-01-01"
}
```

notice that we are using `dateOfBirth` as a string in the JSON document. we will also use inbuilt *JSON Schema* formats to validate the date format. 


## Schema Definition

`oneOf` keyword is used to define properties with multiple types. It ensures that **exactly one** of the specified *subschemas* is valid. 

We will combine using `oneOf` and `required`, to ensure that only one of the properties is present in the JSON document.

add `format: "date"` to the `dateOfBirth` property to validate the date format.
this will ensure that the date is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "dateOfBirth": { "type": "string", "format": "date" }
  },
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"] },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] }
  ]
}
```

Now, Let's try to add the `format` and `oneOf` keyword to the schema given in the right side editor.

<GoodToKnowBox>
you can also use the `not` keyword to ensure that both properties are not present at the same time.

**Example**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  ...
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"], "not": { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] } },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"], "not": { "required": ["age"] } }
  ]
}
```
