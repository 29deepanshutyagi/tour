# Arrays

we have learned to define an object schema with properties using the `properties` keyword, and added properties with `string` and `number` types .

We will continue with the Employee schema and add a new property `skills` which is an **array of strings**. 


```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "skills": ["Python","Pandas"]
}
```


## Defining an array property
  
  ```json 
  {
    ...
      "skills": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
  }
  ```

> We use the `items` keyword to define the type of items in the array. In this case, we are defining that the array should contain only strings. 

using the above schema as a reference, add definition `skills` property to the schema which is given to you in the editor 

<GoodToKnowBox>
  When you use json schema with an implementer, you might encounter `$schema` keyword. This keyword is used to specify the version of the JSON Schema standard that the schema is written in.


  for example, 
  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    ...
  }
  ```

  The above schema is written in the JSON Schema draft 2020-12 standard. For the rest of the tour we will use the latest JSON Schema **draft 2020-12 standard** and we are not going to include `$schema` keyword in the schema for simplicity.
