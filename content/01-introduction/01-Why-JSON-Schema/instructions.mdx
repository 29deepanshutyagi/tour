# JSON Schema Tour
Welcome to the JSON Schema Tour! In this interactive tour your will be introduced to JSON Schema. You will learn how to use JSON Schema to validate JSON documents.


## Are there any prerequisites?
**No!** You just need to know what [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/what-is-json) is.

## Why JSON Schema?
When you are working with JSON data, you may want to ensure that your json data is in a specific format. 

This is where JSON Schema can help you. JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

## The Smallest JSON Schema

Consider you have a json document like this:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
We can see that the this json document has two properties: `name` and `age`.

Name is a string and age is a number.

We can write a JSON Schema for this json document like this:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
	"name": {
	  "type": "string"
	},
	"age": {
	  "type": "number"
	}
  }
}
``` 

You are give this JSON Schema in the editor. Change the value of `type` to `string` for the `age` property, and click validate to see if the JSON document is valid or not.
