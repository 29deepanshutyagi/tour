# Constraining Number

We want to constrain the age of the employee to be between 18 and 60.
and add a date of birth object with the properties `day`, `month`, and `year`.


```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={8}
{
  "name": "John Doe ",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": {
    "day": 1,
    "month": 1,
    "year": 1995
  }
}
```

we want to set the `role` field to a constant value of `employee`.


## Schema Definition

We just need to define the `role` property in the schema with the type `string` and the constant value `employee`.

```json 
{
  ...
    "role": {
      "const": "employee"
    }
}
```

add this definition to the schema which is given to you in the editor

<GoodToKnowBox>

The values passed to the `const` keyword are **case-sensitive**.

`"const": "employee"` is valid 

`"const": "Employee"` is **in**valid
