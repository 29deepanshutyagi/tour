# Constraining Number

You may want to constrain the value of a number to a specific **range** or set a **minimum** or **maximum** value.

Consider a new property `dateOfBirth` with and you want to set specific ranges for `day`, `month` and `year`.
you will also need to set range constraints for the `age` property


```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={8}
{
  "name": "John Doe ",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": {
    "day": 1,
    "month": 1,
    "year": 1995
  }
}
```


## Schema Definition

To apply constraints on number values, you can use the following keywords:

- x ≥ `minimum`
- x > `exclusiveMinimum`
- x ≤ `maximum`
- x < `exclusiveMaximum`


### Example: age property 

```json
{
  "age":{
    type: "number",
    minimum: 18,
    maximum: 60
  }
}
```

### Example: dateOfBirth property 

```json 
{
  "dateOfBirth": {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      "year": {
        type: "number",
        minimum: 1954,
        maximum: 2024
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

now try to add the `age` and `dateOfBirth` properties in the schema given on the right side editor with the constraints mentioned below:

- `age` should be between 18 and 60
- `dateOfBirth.year` should be between 1964 and 2024 
- `dateOfBirth.month` should be between 1 and 12
- `dateOfBirth.day` should be between 1 and 31


You can also use the `exclusiveMinimum` and `exclusiveMaximum` keywords in the schema. 
For example: to set the age between 18 to 60 you can set `exclusiveMinimum : 15` and `exclusiveMaximum : 61`
