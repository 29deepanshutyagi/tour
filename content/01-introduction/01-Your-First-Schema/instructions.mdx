# JSON Schema Tour
Welcome to the JSON Schema Tour! In this interactive tour your will be introduced to JSON Schema. You will learn how to use JSON Schema to validate JSON documents.


## Are there any prerequisites?
**No!** You just need to know what [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/what-is-json) is.

## What is JSON Schema?

JSON Schema is a language used for defining the _structure_ of a JSON document. You can use a _schema_ to validate or document an other json, which we call _instance_.

## First Schema 
We will start with a simple example.
Consider you have a JSON document of an employee:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
 This json document has two properties:
 - `name` with value `John Doe` (string)
 - `age` with value `25` (number)


You are given an incomplete schema for this data on right side editor. 
Add `age` property to the schema and set `type` to `number`.
