# JSON Schema Tour
Welcome to the JSON Schema Tour! In this interactive tour your will be introduced to JSON Schema. You will learn how to use JSON Schema to validate JSON documents.


## Are there any prerequisites?
**No!** You just need to know what [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/what-is-json) is.

## What is JSON Schema?
When you are working with JSON data, you may want to ensure that your json data is in a specific format, you may want to enforce some constraints on the data.

This is where JSON Schema can help you. JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

## First Schema 
We will start with a simple example.
Consider you have a json document of an employee:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
 This json document has two properties:
 - `name` with value `John Doe` (string)
 - `age` with value `25` (number)


You are given an incomplete schema for this data in the editor. 
Add `age` property to the schema and set `type` to `number`.
