# Nesting Objects

we have learned to define an object schema with properties using the `properties` keyword, and added properties with `string` and `number` types .

In this step, we will learn how to nest objects within objects.
We have divided the name property into `firstName`, `lastName`, and `MiddleName`.

```json highlightLineStart={3} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "MiddleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Schema for nested objects

```json 
{
 ...
  "name":{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "firstName": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "lastName": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "MiddleName": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}

```

In the above schema, we have defined the `name` property as an object with three properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and `MiddleName` with `string` type.

<GoodToKnowBox>
  When you use json schema with an implementer, you might encounter `$schema` keyword. This keyword is used to specify the version of the JSON Schema standard that the schema is written in.

for example,

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  ...
}
```

The above schema is written in the JSON Schema draft 2020-12 standard. For the rest of the tour we will use the latest JSON Schema **draft 2020-12 standard** and we are not going to include `$schema` keyword in the schema for simplicity.
