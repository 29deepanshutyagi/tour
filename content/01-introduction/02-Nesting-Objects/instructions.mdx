# Nesting Objects

You have learned to define an object schema with properties using the `properties` keyword, and added properties with `string` and `number` types .

In this step, you will learn how to nest objects within objects.
Let's divide the name property into the separate components `firstName`, `lastName`, and `MiddleName` .

```json highlightLineStart={3} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "MiddleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Schema for nested objects

In _JSON Schema_, you nest objects within objects by defining the `type` as `object` and adding the `properties` keyword to define the nested properties.

```json 
{
 ...
  "name":{
    "type": "object", // it was string in previous example
    "properties": {
      "firstName": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "lastName": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "MiddleName": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}

```



Now, try to add the `name` property of the schema given on the right side editor to include the new properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and `MiddleName` with the `type` set to `string`.
