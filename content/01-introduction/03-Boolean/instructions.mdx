# Boolean 

Now we want to define a boolean property for our employee object - `isFullTime`

```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name": "John Doe ",
  "age": 25,
  "isFullTime": true
}
```


## Schema Definition

We just need to define the `isFullTime` property in the schema with the type `boolean`.
  
  ```json 
  {
    ...
      "isFullTime": {
        "type": "boolean"
      }
  }

  ```
add this definition to the schema which is given to you in the editor
