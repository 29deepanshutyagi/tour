# Age or Date of Birth

In the previous step, we had `age` and `dateOfBirth` properties in the schema. However, we want to make sure that only one of these properties is present in the JSON document.

**We will keep these conditions in mind:**
- if `age` is present, `dateOfBirth` should not be present, and vice versa.
- both `age` and `dateOfBirth` should not be present at the same time.
- if none of them is present, the document should be invalid.

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": {
    "day": 1,
    "month": 1,
    "year": 1995
  }
}
```


## Schema Definition

`oneOf` keyword is used to define properties with multiple types. It ensures that only one of the specified schemas is valid. 

We will combine using `oneOf` and `required`, to ensure that only one of the properties is present in the JSON document.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  ...
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"] },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] }
  ]
}
```

Now, Let's try to add the `oneOf` keyword to the schema given in the right side editor.

<GoodToKnowBox>
you can also use the `not` keyword to ensure that both properties are not present at the same time.

**Example**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  ...
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"], "not": { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] } },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"], "not": { "required": ["age"] } }
  ]
}
```
