# Enumerated values

In the previous step, we have learned to define a constant value for a property using the `const` keyword. However a role of an employee can not be just `employee` it can be also `manager`, `admin` etc.

We want to constrain  the value of the `role` property to a fixed set of values which are `employee`, `manager` and `admin`.


**For Example:** both of these values for role is valid in the below data
```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name": "John Doe ",
  "age": 25,
  "role": "manager"
}
```
```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name": "John Doe ",
  "age": 25,
  "role": "admin"
}
```



We can use the `enum` keyword to define this fixed set of values for a property.

## Schema Definition

Here is how we can define the `role` property in the schema with the type `string` and the fixed set of values `employee`, `manager` and `admin`.

```json 
{
  ...
    "role": {
      "enum": ["employee", "manager", "admin"]
    }
}
```
