# Constants 

Constant values are values that are fixed and cannot be changed. In JSON Schema, we can define constant values using the `const` keyword.

```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name": "John Doe ",
  "age": 25,
  "role": "employee"
}
```

we want to set the `role` field to a constant value of `employee`.


## Schema Definition

We just need to define the `role` property in the schema with the type `string` and the constant value `employee`.

```json 
{
  ...
    "role": {
      "const": "employee"
    }
}
```

add this definition to the schema which is given to you in the editor

The values passed to the `const` keyword are **case-sensitive**.

`"const": "employee"` is valid 

`"const": "Employee"` is **in**valid
