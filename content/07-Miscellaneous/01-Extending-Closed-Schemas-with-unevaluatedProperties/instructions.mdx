# Extending Closed Schemas

Previously in the Objects module, we learned to `additionalProperties`. However, it is important to note that `additionalProperties` only recognizes properties declared in the same *subschema* as itself. 

So, `additionalProperties` can restrict you from "extending" a schema using combining keywords such as `allOf`. In the following example, we can see how the `additionalProperties` can cause attempts to extend the address schema example to fail. 

```json highlightLineStart={11}
{
  "allOf": [
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street_address": { "type": "string" },
        "city": { "type": "string" },
        "state": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["street_address", "city", "state"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  ],
  "properties": {
    "type": { "enum": [ "residential", "business" ] }
  },
  "required": ["type"]
}
```
The above schema will not allow you to define `type` property. because `additionalProperties` is set to `false`. The reason is, `additionalProperties` only recognizes properties declared in the same subschema. 


## Unevaluated Properties

The challenge we saw with `additionalProperties` can be solved using the `unevaluatedProperties` keyword. This keyword allows you to define properties that are not evaluated by the current schema. 

```json highlightLineStart={15}
{
  "allOf": [
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street_address": { "type": "string" },
        "city": { "type": "string" },
        "state": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["street_address", "city", "state"],    }
  ],
  "properties": {
    "type": { "enum": [ "residential", "business" ] }
  },
  "unevaluatedProperties": false,
  "required": ["type"]
}
```

## Task 

You are give the same schema in the <SideEditorLink/>. Add `unevaluatedProperties` to the schema to allow the only `number` as an additional property.
