# Extending Closed Schemas

Previously in the Objects module, we learned about `additionalProperties`. However, it is important to note that `additionalProperties` only recognizes properties declared in the same [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) as itself.

This limitation can restrict you from "extending" a schema using combining [keywords](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) such as `$ref`. In the following example, we use `$ref` to extend the address schema (`https://example.com/address`) by adding a `type` property while controlling additional properties. This approach showcases how `unevaluatedProperties` resolves the challenges of extending schemas.

```json highlightLineStart={6,13,16}
{
  "$ref": "https://example.com/address",
  "properties": {
    "type": { "enum": [ "residential", "business" ] }
  },
  "required": ["type"],
  "unevaluatedProperties": false
}
