Hi, Welcome to the JSON Schema tour. This tour is designed to help you understand JSON Schema, a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

# Why JSON Schema? Understanding JSON and Its Need for Schema

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
