# Exclusively Constraining Number

We have added a new property `salary` to the JSON object. In this step we will define ranges for the `age` and `salary` properties.




```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "salary": 50000
}
```


## Schema Definition

To apply exclusive constraints on number values, you can use the following keywords:

- x > `exclusiveMinimum`
- x < `exclusiveMaximum`


now try to add the `age` and `salary` properties in the schema given on the <SideEditorLink/> with the constraints mentioned below using `exclusiveMinimum` and `exclusiveMaximum` keywords:

- `age` should be **greater than 18** and **less than 60**
- `salary` should be **greater than 30000** and **less than 80000**
