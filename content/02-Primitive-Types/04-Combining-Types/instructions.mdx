# Combining Types - Boolean and Null

In out previous examples, we have set the types of properties as `string` and `integer`. But **what if you want to combine different types for a single property?**

Let's add a new property `hasAgreedToTerms` to the JSON object. This property should be a boolean value, but it can also be `null`.

```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "hasAgreedToTerms": true,
}
```

## Defining the Schema 

In _JSON Schema_, you can define multiple types by passing **an array of types** to the `type` field. 
**Example:**

```json 
{
  "type": ["boolean", "null"]
}
```



Now, try to modify the `hasAgreedToTerms` property on the right side editor to accept both `boolean` and `null` values.
