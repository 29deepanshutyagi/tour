# Enumerated Values II

Previously, we have used enumerated values only for strings. However, you can also **use them for any type**, including numbers and null values.

```json
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "performanceRating": 4
}
```
Let's say you want to restrict the `performanceRating` to only a few specific values. You can use the `enum` keyword to define the allowed values.

**Example**
  
```json
{
  "enum": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]
}
```

Now, modify the `performanceRating` property on the side editor to accept only the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and null.
