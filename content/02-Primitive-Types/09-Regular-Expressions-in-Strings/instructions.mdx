# Regular Expressions in Strings

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns in strings. They are widely used in programming languages and tools for tasks like searching, replacing, and validating strings.

In this step, we will use regular expressions to validate the format `postalCode` and `phoneNumber` fields in the JSON object.


```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "postalCode": "385004",
  "phoneNumber": "84584898564"
}
```

## `pattern` Keyword

In *JSON Schema*, you can use the `pattern` keyword to define a regular expression pattern that a string value must match.

**Example**

```
{
  "type": "string",
  "pattern": "^[0-9]{6}$"
}
```

try to modify the `postalCode` and `phoneNumber` fields in the right-side editor with the below constraints in mind.

**Constraints:**
- The `postalCode` should be a string with a length of **exactly 6** characters and should **contain only digits.**
- The `phoneNumber` should be a string with a **minimum length of 10** characters and should **contain only digits**.
