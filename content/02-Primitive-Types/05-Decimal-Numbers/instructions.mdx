# Decimal Numbers

So far in the tour, we have defined `age` as an integer. However, `integer` does not allow decimal numbers. If you want to allow decimal numbers, you can use the `number` type.

Consider a new property, `performanceRating`. 

```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "performanceRating": 4.5
}
```

Now, Try to modify the `performanceRating` property on the right side editor to accept decimal numbers with `minimum` value as `0` and `maximum` value as `5`.
