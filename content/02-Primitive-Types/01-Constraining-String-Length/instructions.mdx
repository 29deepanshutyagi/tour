# Constraining String Length

Let's add two new fields `postalCode` and `phoneNumber` to the JSON object. You may want to constrain the length of these fields to ensure that they meet certain requirements.

```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "postalCode": "385004",
  "phoneNumber": "84584898564"
}
```

### minLength and maxLength

In JSON Schema, you can use the `minLength` and `maxLength` keywords to define the minimum and maximum length of a string.

**Example**

```json

{
  ...
  "postalCode": {
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 6,
    "maxLength": 6
  }
}
```

Now, try to add the `postalCode` and `phoneNumber` fields in the right-side editor with the below constraints in mind.

**Constraints:**
- The `postalCode` should be a string with a length of **exactly 6** characters. 
- The `phoneNumber` should be a string with a **minimum length of 10** characters.
