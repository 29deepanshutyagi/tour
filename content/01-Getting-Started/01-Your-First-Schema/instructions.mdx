# JSON Schema Tour
Welcome to the *JSON Schema* Tour! In this interactive tour you will be introduced to *JSON Schema*. You will learn how to use **JSON Schema draft 2020-12** to validate JSON documents.


## Are there any prerequisites?
**No!** You just need to know what [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/what-is-json) is.

## What is JSON Schema?

JSON Schema is a language used for defining the _structure_ of a JSON document. You can use a _schema_ to validate or document an other JSON, which we call _instance_.

## First Schema 
Let's start with a simple example.
Consider you have a JSON document of an employee:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
 This json document has two properties:
 - `name` with value `John Doe` (string)
 - `age` with value `25` (integer)


You are given an incomplete *schema* for this data on right side editor. 

Now, try to Add `age` property to the *schema* and set `type` to `integer`.
