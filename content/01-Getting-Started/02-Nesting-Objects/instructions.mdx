# Nesting Objects

You have learned to define an object schema with properties using the `properties` keyword, and added properties with `string` and `integer` types .

In this step, you will learn how to nest objects within objects.
Let's divide the name property into the three separate components: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName` 

```json highlightLineStart={3} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "middleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Schema for nested objects

In _JSON Schema_, you nest objects within objects by defining the `type` as `object` and adding the `properties` keyword to define the nested properties.

**Example**
```json
{
  ...
  "name": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {},
  }
}
```


Now, try to modify the `name` property on the right side editor to add `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName` with type `string`.
