# Age or Date of Birth

Let's add a new property `dateOfBirth` to the JSON document.


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": "1999-01-01"
}
```

**Now you want to apply these conditions in the document:**
- if `age` is present, `dateOfBirth` should not be present, and vice versa.
- both `age` and `dateOfBirth` should not be present at the same time.
- if none of them is present, the document should be invalid.



## Schema Definition

To apply these conditions you can use `oneOf` keyword. `oneOf` ensures that **exactly one** of the specified *subschemas* is valid. 

We will combine using `oneOf` and `required`, to ensure that only one of the properties is present in the JSON document.


```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "dateOfBirth": { "type": "string", "format": "date" }
  },
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"] },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] }
  ]
}
```

Notice the `format` keyword with `date` used in the `dateOfBirth` property. By default, `format` is just an annotation and **does not effect validation**. you can learn more about the format keyword [here](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string#format).

Now, Let's try to add the `format` and `oneOf` keyword to the schema given in the right side editor.

you can also use the `not` keyword to ensure that both properties are not present at the same time.

**Example**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  ...
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"], "not": { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] } },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"], "not": { "required": ["age"] } }
  ]
}
```
