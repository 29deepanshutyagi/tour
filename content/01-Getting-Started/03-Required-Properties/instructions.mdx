# Required Properties

In the previous example, the `name` had three properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName`. In this step, you will learn how to define the required properties in JSON Schema.

```json
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "middleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Schema Definition

You can use the `required` keyword to define the required properties in an object. 

Properties listed in the `required` array **must be present** in the object.
if those properties are not present, the JSON data is considered invalid.


**Example**
```json
{
  ...
  "name": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {...},
    "required": ["firstName", "lastName"],
  }
}
```


Now, try to modify the `name` property on the right side editor to add `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName` with type `string`.
