# Combining Types

You have learned to define an object schema with properties using the `properties` keyword, and added properties with `string` and `integer` types .

In this step, you will learn how to nest objects within objects.
Let's divide the name property into the three separate components: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName` 

```json highlightLineStart={3} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "middleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Schema for nested objects

In _JSON Schema_, you nest objects within objects by defining the `type` as `object` and adding the `properties` keyword to define the nested properties.

```json 
{
 ...
  "name":{
    "type": "object", // it was string in previous example
    "properties": {
      "firstName": {"type": "string"},
      "lastName": {"type": "string"},
      "middleName": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
  },
  ...
}

```

`required` keyword is used to specify the required properties in an object. In the above example, `firstName` and `lastName` are required properties. 

**Properties mentioned in `required` must be present in the object**

Now, try to add the `name` property on the right side editor with `required` constrain
