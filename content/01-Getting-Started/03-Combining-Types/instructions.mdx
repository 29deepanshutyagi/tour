# Combining Types

In out previous example, we have set the types of properties as `string` and `number`. But what if you want to combine different types for a single property?

**Example,** a person may or may not have a middle name. so you want to set the `middleName` property as `null` or `string`.

```json highlightLineStart={5} 
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "middleName": null
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Defining the Schema 

In _JSON Schema_, you can define multiple types by passing **an array of types** to the `type` field. 
**Example:**

```json highlightLineStart={6} 
{
  "properties": {
    "name": {     
      "properties": {
        "middleName": {
          "type": ["string", "null"]
        }
        ...
      },
    },
  }
}
```



Now, try to add the `type` property of `middleName` to include both `string` and `null` types.
