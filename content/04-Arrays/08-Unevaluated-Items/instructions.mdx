# Unevaluated Items

**What are Unevaluated Items?**

So far, we have used `items`, `prefixItems` and `contains` [keywords](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define [subschemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) for the elements of an array. However, sometimes you many want to handle the items that are unevaluated by these keywords.

In such cases, you can use the `unevaluatedItems` keyword to define a subschema for the unevaluated items in the array.

- By definition, the `unevaluatedItems` subschema is always applied after `prefixItems`, `items`, and `contains` subschemas.
- As its name implies, `unevaluatedItems` applies to any array index that has not been previously evaluated.



## Example

Consider, we have defined array items with `prefixItems`. When you have items more than the defined `prefixItems`, you can use `unevaluatedItems` to define a subschemas for the remaining items.


```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "prefixItems": [
    { "type": "number" },
    { "type": "string" }
  ],
  "unevaluatedItems": { "type": "number" }
}
```

In this case, first two items are evaluated by `prefixItems` and the remaining items are evaluated by `unevaluatedItems`.


## Task 

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "skills": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"]
}
```

Modify the `skills` property of the given schema on the <SideEditorLink/> such that, 
- First three elements can have only "HTML", "CSS" and "JavaScript" as values (in any order), not anything else.
- The remaining elements are of type string.

> **Hints:** 
> - For the first constrain use `prefixItems` combined with `enum` keyword.
> - For the second constrain use `unevaluatedItems` keyword.
