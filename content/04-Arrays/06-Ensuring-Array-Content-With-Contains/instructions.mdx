# Ensuring Array Content with the 'contains'

The `contains` keyword is used to ensure that an array contains **at least one element** that matches the [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) defined in the `contains` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword).

## Example

In the following example, we have a JSON Schema that validates an array of numbers. The schema ensures that the array contains at least one element that is less than 10.

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "contains": {
    "type": "number",
    "maximum": 10
  }
}
```
## Task 

Our employee document has a field called `skills`. 

```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java"]
}
```

Now, we want to ensure that the `skills` array contains at least one element that is equal to `"JavaScript"`. modify the schema given to you in the <SideEditorLink/> to apply this constrain.

> **Hint:** Use the `const` keyword to specify JavaScript as the required element.
