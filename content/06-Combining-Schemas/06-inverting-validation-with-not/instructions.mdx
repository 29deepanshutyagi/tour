# Inverting Validation with not


`not` keyword is used to invert the validation. If the [_instance_](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#instance) is **not** valid against the [subschemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema), the document is considered valid.


```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
}
```

We want the `age` to be greater then or equal to 18. but it should not be 21. We can use `not` keyword to define this condition.


```json highlightLineStart={8} 
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 18,
      "not": {"const": 21}
    }
  },
}
```

## Task

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 21,
  "status": "active"
}
```

Modify the schema given to you in the <SideEditorLink/> to ensure that the document is valid if:
- `status` is **not** `null`.
