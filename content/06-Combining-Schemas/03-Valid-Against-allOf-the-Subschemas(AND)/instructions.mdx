# Valid Against allOf the Subschemas (AND) 

When you want to ensure that an instance is valid against **all of** the subschemas, you can use the `allOf` keyword. 

You can think of `allOf` as an **AND operation** between subschemas. if one of the subschemas fails, the instance is considered invalid.



```json
{
  "name":"John Doe",
}
```

We will create two subSchemas 1. `minStringLength` and 2. `alphaNumeric` and then combine them using `allOf` in the `name` property.

```json highlightLineStart={10} highlightLineEnd={13}
{
  "$defs": {
    "minStringLength": {"minLength": 5},
    "alphaNumeric": {"pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$"}
  },
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "allOf": [
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/minStringLength" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/alphaNumeric" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The above schema ensures that the `name` property is valid against both the `minStringLength` and `alphaNumeric` subschemas. in other words, the `name` property must have a minimum length of 5 characters and must contain only alphanumeric characters.  

> **Note:** It is **not necessary** to define subschemas using `$defs` and `$ref`. You can directly define the subschemas inline as well.

## Task 

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```

For the given JSON document, you are provided with a schema in the side editor. the schema has defined a subschemas `ageLimit`.
Your task is to: 
- Define a inline subschema that checks if the `age` is of type `integer`
- Combine the `ageLimit` and the inline subschema using `allOf` in the `age` property.
